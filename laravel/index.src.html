<h1 id="time-precision">Time precision</h1>

<p>As soon as you need to store a date (with or without time), you should store a full datetime.
Even if it sounds like you don't need the time, timezone or anything more than the day-precision
for a date such as <code>2020-07-26</code> but July the 26th is not the same day for everyone.
July 26th is a precise period from 07-26 00:00:00 to 07-26 23:59:59.999... But if a person in
New York says 26th July, a person in Auckland talking about the same period would consider
it's 07-26 16:00:00 to 07-27 15:59:59.999... This means if you store only year-month-day dates,
your app can only work in 1 timezone and will never be compatible with any other timezone.</p>

<p>The same way, you won't be able to re-use any date-related component of your app in any
multi-timezones contexts. Nowadays, it make absolutely no sense to work on a mono-timezone
basis. You're 99.99% sure someday your app or a part of your app will be used in more than
1 timezone, so you will need at least to add hour-minute to store worldwide day-precision
(because some timezone have shifts like +4:30 or +8:45), so since you're there, there's
no point to be stingy, you can also store second and then have a standard storing of any
moment no matter the precision you want.</p>

<p>Last, when it comes to precise sorting or you want to take the 3 first people that sent
a request, you will be embarrassed if you see 5 times the same datetime in your log because
people sent requests in the same second.</p>

<p>So, store the maximum precision your engine can (microseconds with PHP and MySQL
for instance) and forget it.</p>

<p>On the long term, this will free your mind, stop worrying about what precision you
got, if you compare 2 moments, you will always have precise difference. Then if you want
to round or truncate a difference, or display in a particular timezone, you still can
because you have the complete data, while if you decide to store less data, it will be
too late to change your mind later regarding existing data.</p>

<p>SQL engines are capable to store date-time millisecond to nanosecond precision, but by default Laravel comes
    with second-precision.</p>

<p>For instance, if you use MySQL, you should extend <code>MySqlGrammar</code> to change the date format:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
// app/Database/Query/Grammars/MySqlGrammar.php

namespace App\Database\Query\Grammars;

class MySqlGrammar extends \Illuminate\Database\Query\Grammars\MySqlGrammar
{
    public function getDateFormat()
    {
        return 'Y-m-d H:i:s.u';
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Then edit the boot method of <strong>app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="php">class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
    * Bootstrap any application services.
    *
    * @return void
    */
    public function boot()
    {
        DB::connection()->setQueryGrammar(new \App\Database\Query\Grammars\MySqlGrammar);
    }</code></pre>

<p>Then to be properly stored this precision, add the precision attribute (6 for 6-digits length decimal part) in
    migrations, for instance the default migration of users would become to store the microseconds precision:</p>

<pre><code class="php">Schema::create('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('name');
    $table->string('email')->unique();
    $table->timestamp('email_verified_at', 6)->nullable();
    $table->string('password');
    $table->rememberToken();
    $table->timestamps(6);
});</code></pre>

<p>If the migration has already been ran, use an update:</p>

<pre><code class="php">Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->timestamp('created_at', 6)->nullable();
    $table->timestamp('updated_at', 6)->nullable();
});</code></pre>

<p>Now you can free your mind from this point and use <code>->timestamp('x', 6)</code>
each time you need to store any date or time related data.</p>

<h1 id="localization">Localization</h1>

<p>When storing a datetime, you should also consider the location where this moment is
considered, you can store it with any timezone. If a user buy an airplane flight
ticket, you may want to display departure time (with origin timezone), arrival
time (with destination timezone) and let's say also online check-in deadline and
order time (with current browser timezone).</p>

<p>Here you can distinguish dates to be considered in a fixed timezone (departure
and arrival) and the ones that can actually be displayed in any timezone.</p>

<p>Let's see the departure/arrival first. You may be tempted to just store date
considered in each airport. So flying from Reykjavik (‏KEF)‏ to Athènes (‏ATH)‏, you
can get 2020-11-04 10:00 and 2020-11-04 14:00, this would allow you to display
the raw data: 10:00 (REK) -&gt; 14:00 (ATH), great. But now to calculate the
flight duration, you will need to convert one or the other to get the diff
because the flight is 6-hour and not 4-hour long. And even more tricky, let's
now output the 5 next flights. You have mixed timezones in your DB (database),
so you can't rely on the DB optimizations to sort and limit the result. You can't
even now which flight already took off or not without converting every date
in a reference timezone. That's a shame.</p>

<p>That's why, in your DB, <strong>every dates</strong> should be stored in
the same timezone. This way, you can sort, compare, sub/add with no conversion.</p>

<h2>Which timezone to choose?</h2>

<p>Many businesses/organizations made the mistake of taking their business or server
location as the reference timezone. You should think bigger! Someday you may move your
server, become an international company, or you may simply want to reuse a part
of your app or your DB. Then the timezone your originally picked will make
absolutely no sense, and if you have to merge with an other DB, it will no longer
be consistent.</p>

<p>Even worse, if you choose a timezone with DST as reference (USA, Europe, etc.)
then you will have calculation errors (for instance, the given flight above will
give you 5 or 7 hours instead of 6 when there is a DST change in your reference
timezone during the flight).</p>

<h2>UTC is the reference</h2>

<p>The worldwide time system standard is UTC, it defines each timezone from
GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) +/- a given time shift. So to maximize your compatibility
and avoid painful issues, use <code>'UTC'</code> as the default timezone of
your app and to store any moment in your DB or any other storage.</p>

<p>This is also the timezone you should choose for your APIs. For instance, in
a JSON API, a date should looks like <code>"2020-03-19T08:44:40.593Z"</code>,
Browser will understand <code>Z</code> as Zulu timezone (an other synonym for
<code>GMT+0</code> or <code>UTC+0</code>) and for instance, if you call
<code>new Date("2020-03-19T08:44:40.593Z")</code> in Paris, you'll get
<code>Thu Mar 19 2020 09:44:40 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time)</code>,
if you call it in New York:
<code>Thu Mar 19 2020 04:44:40 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)</code>.
This would actually be the better way for check-in deadline and
order time in the example above.</p>

<p>This actually means you will convert dates to an other timezone server-side
very rarely, only if you have to display it in a view.</p>

<p>In the previous example, the timezone could be calculated from airport
localization, if you need a fixed timezone but don't have the needed data
stored to retrieve it, then you should simply add a <code>text</code> column
in your DB table to store <code>"Europe/Paris"</code> or <code>"America/New_York"</code>.
Use the city timezones and not the shift (like <code>UTC+08</code>) else
you won't be able to know which DST rules to apply if you have to modify the
date or calculate a new date based on the first one.</p>

<p>Last, you don't need to store a timezone string for each timezone-fixed date,
you should apply the logic relation/grouping according to your need. For instance,
if you want to send e-mails with dates to your users, you can't access the browsers
when sending mails so you have to pick a timezone, you can use the last known
timezone of the user (supposing you update some users table field with the
browser timezone when a user log in your app). In this case, you obviously don't
need to store the timezone for each stored date, you can simply save one and reuse
it for every dates in all e-mails for a given user.</p>

<p>Laravel comes with <code>'UTC'</code> as default timezone, you can check and fix
it in the <strong>config/app.php</strong> file:</p>

<pre><code class="php">/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Application Timezone
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here you may specify the default timezone for your application, which
| will be used by the PHP date and date-time functions. We have gone
| ahead and set this to a sensible default for you out of the box.
|
*/

'timezone' => 'UTC',</code></pre>
